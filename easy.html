                <h3>HIstory</h3>
                <p>Cancer is one of the pandemic dieases in the world<br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Genetic</li>
                        <li>Mutation</li>

                    <p>
                        <span>HOw the tumor will form from normal cell</span><br>
                        NOramally cell division can done by two method,
                        <ol>
                            <li>Mitosis</li>
                            <li>Meosis</li>
                        </ol>
                        mitosis which means that the cell divided into 2 from the parent cell.
                        and the meosisi which means that the it divided into 4 cell from the parent cell.
                    </p>
