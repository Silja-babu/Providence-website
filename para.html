        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <div class="intro">
            <h4>History behind throughtout</h3>
            <p class="his">
                normal cell cancerous cell and bengin cell are formed due to the cell division. 
                When it become controlled manner then it will twads to the camceroursand benign cells.
                cencerous and benign cell are identify a difficult task. because benign cell acts like a cancerous
                and normal cell.
            </p>
            <h4>Normal cell division</h4>
            <p class="nor">
                NOrmally cell division occur in 2 manner one is mitosis and other is meosis. Where mitosis is be like a parent cell is divided ionto 2 daughter cell.
                where meosis is parent cell is divied into 4 daughter cell.
            </p>
            <h4>Benign cell</h4>
            <p class="ben">
                BEnign cell is due to cell division but its division is due to some mutation and other genetc disorder. 
                sometimes it will become the beginner of the cancerous cell or it will just like a death mass cell.
            </p>
            <h4>Cancerous cell</h4>
            <p class="can">
                Cancerous cell is tumor and it have high mass as compared to other cell.

            </p>

            <h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>
            <p class="Ai">Artificial intelligence or ai is the most emering techonologies in the world. 
                It is really a mimic of the human brain. human brain is the the controller of all our body . when turns 
            into an ai it will act and think like human brain</p>
            <h4>DEEP Learning</h4>
            <P>DEEP learning is the advance of the machine learning in that system can think just like human beings
                ank also can take decision
            </P>
