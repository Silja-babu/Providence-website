                <h2>Biopsy or mammogram</h2>
                <p>
                        biopsy and mammogram have take two different pattern of the detection of tumor.
                        which one is best is a  big question because both are taken as a primary stage for the detection of the cancers.
                        so as comparing to the deep laerning based detection of tumor is more advanced. but in that case also mammogram or biopsy is required to 
                        taken as the 1st step for classification. as as comparing to the latest technology inthe world i can surely say as we want an non inversive And
                        and reduced side effect and fast recongising technology is needed to find out the cancer. so in my paper work i can surely say that phonotic crystal
                        in terta hertz regime is best techonoly in the world. tera hertz radiation is doesnot harmful to the human beings. It just only inverse our body and collect 
                        information about the water conduct in our body.tumor cell need lots of wastyer as compared to the normal cell. tera hertz radiation will absorb that much of 
                        radiation inthat tumor cell.

            <h2>Your Point Of View</h2>
            <p>from this above area what do you think about the technology. biopsy and mammogram are currently using here fot the detection of cancwr and benign cell but in that case also 
               we need some expert on that stage when in the case of an CNN based cancer detection once we implement this software then we cancheck it from anywhere at any time.
