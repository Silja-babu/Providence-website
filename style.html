        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h3>History Behind The Breast Cancer</h3>
        <p>Cancer is the one of the most pandemic diesese in the world it doesnot have a particular medicine to cure it. 
        Only one method is to identify it earlier then we can reduce the effects of the cancer. cancer si caused by the uncontrolled division
        of the cell. Breast cancer is the 2nd largest in the world it is mainly reconginze to the female and it is highest death rate when considering 
        the other cancer. </p>

        <h3>What is Breast Cancer</h3> 
            <p>Breast cancer is controlled cell division on the breast cells. cell division are 2 type mitosis and meosis.
                Mitosis which means that parent cell divide into 2 daughter cell and meosis which means that division of parent cell into 4 daughter cells
                Breast cancer is a kind of cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the breast tissue.

                After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. But breast cancer doesn't just happen in women. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer.
                
                Breast cancer survival rates have been increasing. And the number of people dying of breast cancer is steadily going down. Much of this is due to the widespread support for breast cancer awareness and funding for research.
                
                Advances in breast cancer screening allow healthcare professionals to diagnose breast cancer earlier. Finding the cancer earlier makes it much more likely that the cancer can be cured. Even when breast cancer can't be cured, 
                many treatments exist to extend life. 
                New discoveries in breast cancer research are helping healthcare professionals choose the most effective treatment plans.

        <h3>Reasons Behind Breast Cancer</h3>
            <p>Genetic and mutation is the main reason behind the Breast cancer.
                <br>
                <strong>Genetic</strong>
                <br>
                cancer is a genetic disease. It is caused by changes in genes that control the way cells grow and multiply. Cells are the building blocks of your body. Each cell has a copy of your genes, which act like an instruction manual.

                Genes are sections of DNA that carry instructions to make a protein or several proteins. 
                Scientists have found hundreds of DNA and genetic changes (also called variants, mutations, or alterations) that help cancer form, grow, and spread.
                
                Cancer-related genetic changes can occur because: 
                <ul>
                    <li> mistakes in our DNA happen as our cells multiply</li> 
                    <li> DNA is altered by carcinogens in our environment, such as chemicals in tobacco smoke, UV rays from the sun, 
                        and the human papillomavirus (HPV) </li>
                    <li> were inherited from one of our parents </li>
                </ul> 
                <P>   
                    DNA changes, whether caused by a random mistake or by a carcinogen, can happen throughout our lives and even in the womb. 
                    While most genetic changes arenâ€™t harmful on their own, an accumulation of genetic changes over many years can turn healthy cells into cancerous cells.
                    The vast majority of cancers occur by chance as a result of this process over time.
                </P>
                <br>
                
                <strong>Mutation</strong><br>
                <P>
                    Mutations can happen by chance when a cell is dividing. They can also be caused by the processes of life inside the cell. Or by things coming from outside the body, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke. And some people can inherit faults in particular genes that make them more likely to develop a cancer.

                    Some genes get damaged every day and cells are very good at repairing them. But over time, the damage may build up. And once cells start growing too fast, they are more likely to pick up further mutations and less likely to be able to repair the damaged genes.

        <h3>AI or Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <P>Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a 
                way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. 

                AI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, including computer science, data analytics and statistics, hardware and 
                software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology. 
                
                On an operational level for business use, AI is a set of technologies that are based primarily on 
                machine learning and deep learning, used for data analytics, predictions and forecasting, object categorization, 
                natural language processing, recommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and more.

        <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
             <P>
                Deep neural networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, each building on the previous layer to refine and optimize 
                the prediction or categorization. This progression of computations through the network is called forward propagation. The input and output 
                layers of a deep neural network are called visible layers. The input layer is where the deep learning model ingests the data for processing, 
                and the output layer is where the final prediction or classification is made.

                Another process called backpropagation uses algorithms, such as gradient descent, to calculate errors in predictions, 
                
                and then adjusts the weights and biases of the function by moving backwards through the layers to train the model.
                Together, forward propagation and backpropagation enable a neural network to make predictions and correct for any errors.
                Over time, the algorithm becomes gradually more accurate.
                
                Deep learning requires a tremendous amount of computing power.
                High-performance graphical processing units (GPUs) are ideal because they can handle a large volume of calculations 
                in multiple cores with copious memory available. Distributed cloud computing might also assist. This level of computing power is 
                necessary to train deep algorithms through deep learning. However, managing multiple GPUs on premises can create a large demand on internal 
                resources and be incredibly costly to scale. For software requirements, most deep learning apps are coded with one of these three learning 
                frameworks: JAX, PyTorch or TensorFlow.
