                    <h2>Mammogram</h2>
                    <p>it is absolutaly done by the radiation or it is dectected by the x-ray radiation. when the radiation hits on the cells the
                        most tumors affected area will absorb the radiation.others will pass the radiation to the detector. so the absence of the of taht
                        will be show as black and the region that absorb part will says as the tumor part.
