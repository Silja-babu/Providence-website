            <p class="breast">BREAST CANCER DETECTION USING CNN ALGORITHM</p>
            <p class="Breast">Breast cancer is the mostpandemic dieases in the world. it doesnot have particular medicine to cure it. the only and only way to reduce the effect by early detection of cancer.
                in mainly it is detected for females when considereing the males.one of the most paandemic and also the most dangerous .Breast cancer is the most pandemic one in the world in 2022 article says that it is growing day by day.
                Currently their are lots of techonolgies is arrived but their is no specific one to irradicate the cancer it is 
            </p>
            <p class="Current">Current method used to find out the the cancer by 
                <ul class="C">
                    <li>Biopsy</li>
                    <li>Mammography</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Biopsy is the collecting cells from the tumor parts.</strong>

                <strong>Mammography is type of radiation based detection it is used to find the masses part from the on a 
                    whole breast and masses part will collect the radiation particle and normal cell will passes the radiation </strong>

            <p class="cell">cancer cell is due to the uncontrolled division of cell. Basically it is a normal procedcure of cell formation it is 2 type mitosis and meosis. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        mitosis is a division of parent cell into 2 daughter cells5
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Meosis is a division of parent cell into 4 daughter cells
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Basic of nerual network</h2>
            <p class="cnn">
                CNN or Convolutional nerual network is algorithm of deep Learning.it is basically used in the image classification or detection.
                 cnn is a subset of nerual network it just work like our brain.
                Brain neuron will act like a current pulse. when a stimula is getting on the dendrite then the signal is pass from dendrite to the dendron. 
                the dendron will place on the tip of the axon then long tube like structure is known as the axon and the tip of the axon their will be a cell body.
